AUSTRALIA BREAK INDIA'S UNBEATEN STREAK TO LIFT THE WORLD CUP | MATCH HIGHLIGHTS | CWC23
The pressure was on Head when Australia slipped to 47/3 in search of a target of 241 to beat India at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad.
But Head produced one of the best knocks of his career, scoring 137 from 120 balls to guide his team to the brink of victory.
HEAD HITS EXCEPTIONAL TON IN WORLD CUP FINAL | CWC23
Head didn’t play a part in the first half of Australia’s campaign, remaining back home to help his recovery from a broken hand before joining the squad midway through the tournament.
And he more than justified Australia’s faith in him – becoming Player of the Match in the Cricket World Cup final in the same year that he was also named Player of the Match in the World Test Championship Final.
The 29-year-old’s outstanding century in the final was ably supported by the resolute Marnus Labuschagne, who held firm at the other end with 58* from 110 balls.
Yet it was Head who defied an Indian bowling attack who threw everything at him on a difficult surface.
The opener was caught in the boundary with just one run required, departing to standing ovation from his team-mates.
TRAVIS HEAD SPECIAL LIFTS THE TROPHY | INNINGS HIGHLIGHTS | CWC23
And it wasn’t just with the bat that Head excelled, with his wonderful catch to remove Rohit Sharma turning the tide in the first innings.
Despite not scoring the winning runs, it was never in doubt that Head would be named Player of the Match after a standout display that earned Australia’s men their sixth Cricket World Cup title.
AUSTRALIA LIFT THE WORLD CUP FOR A RECORD SIXTH OCCASION | CWC23
“What an amazing day, I’m just thrilled to be a part of it,” Head said after his match-winning display.
“It’s a lot better than sitting on the couch at home, I’m very lucky that everything went well and I was able to get back here.
“I was a little bit nervous, but Marnus played exceptional and it was just an amazing partnership.
“It’s nice to be a part of it, nice to play a role, and it’s going to be an amazing couple of days now.
“To be able to do that on the big stage, in front of a big crowd, it’s pretty special and something that I’ll be happy to look back on later in my life. It’s nice to be here and nice to contribute.”

India
- If India do prevail and add another trophy to the World Cup titles they won in 1983 and 2011 they will become the first nation in the history of the Men's Cricket World Cup to have won the tournament twice on home soil after they famously defeated Sri Lanka in Mumbai 12 years ago.

Australia

MOMENTUM BUILDING AS AUSTRALIA EYE SIXTH WORLD CUP TITLE | CWC23
- David Warner has scored six centuries in the history of the Men's Cricket World Cup and could draw level with India captain Rohit Sharma (seven) for most centuries ever at the event by reaching three figures in the final.

Awesome Australia beat India to win the ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup.docx,"Australia produced a magnificent performance to beat India in the final to win the ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup 2023.
The majority of a packed and partisan crowd arrived at the Narendra Modi Stadium hoping to see the host nation end their decade-long wait for a major ICC trophy win.
But it was Australia who delivered on the day. The Australian bowling attack combined to turn the screw after a fast-paced powerplay, bowling India out for 240.
And Travis Head was the star with the bat, hitting an inspired century to win Australia’s men their sixth ICC Cricket World Cup crown.
Victory for Australia is a crowning moment in what has been a phenomenal year for Pat Cummins’ side across formats, adding to their win over India in the World Test Championship final in June and their subsequent retention of the Ashes.
AUSTRALIA LIFT THE WORLD CUP FOR A RECORD SIXTH OCCASION | CWC23
Tasked with a target of 241 to win the World Cup, Australia got off to a fast but shaky start in the face of a new-ball assault from India’s seam attack.
David Warner (7), Mitchell Marsh (15) and Steven Smith (4) all departed cheaply as Australia slipped to 47/3 inside the opening seven overs, with Mohammed Shami and Jasprit Bumrah taking the wickets.
But a superb partnership between Head and Marnus Labuschagne won it for Australia, with Head hitting a stunning century and Labuschagne playing the foil at the other end, bedding in with a resolute half-century of his own.
HEAD HITS EXCEPTIONAL TON IN WORLD CUP FINAL | CWC23
Head was caught in the deep with just one run needed to win the game, departing to a standing ovation from his teammates having scored 137 from 120 runs.
And Glenn Maxwell scored the winning runs as Australia claimed victory with six wickets and seven overs to spare.
Earlier, Australia skipper Pat Cummins won the toss and chose to bowl first in Ahmedabad in-front of a packed crowd. But it was India who got off to a flier, inspired once more by captain Rohit Sharma.
The early loss of Shubman Gill didn’t halt India’s attacking momentum, as Rohit and Virat Kohli racked up the runs in the first ten overs, with 80 runs coming in the first powerplay, equalling the record for a men's Cricket World Cup final.
DISCIPLINED AUSTRALIA TAKE CONTROL AFTER EARLY BLAZE | INNINGS HIGHLIGHTS | CWC23
However, the departure of the skipper for 47 from 31 balls was followed by Shreyas Iyer for 4 in the very next over, and the match took an abrupt turn from that moment on, as the runs dried up through the middle overs.
Looking to rebuild in the face of some excellent bowling on a tricky surface, Kohli and KL Rahul bedded in, ensuring India reached at least a competitive total.
KOHLI'S CRUCIAL HALF-CENTURY HOLDS THE INDIA INNINGS AFTER EARLY LOSSES | CWC23
Wickets fell frequently as Australia’s bowling attack looked to press home their advantage, and the final Indian wicket came off the last ball of the innings, with the total at just 240.
Pat Cummins’ 2/34 from ten overs summed up the effort from the Aussie pacers, with Mitchell Starc taking 3/55 and Josh Hazlewood 2/60. Adam Zampa provided good control through the middle, finishing with 1/44, while Glenn Maxwell’s 1/35 from six overs included the crucial wicket of Rohit.
The innings fell into two distinct sections. Nine fours and three sixes were struck in the first powerplay as India reached 80/2. But in the following 240 balls of the innings, there were no further sixes, only four boundaries and just seven twos – with all other runs coming in singles.
TRAVIS HEAD SPECIAL LIFTS THE TROPHY | INNINGS HIGHLIGHTS | CWC23
The second innings got off to a frenetic start, with David Warner edging the first ball through the slip cordon and scoring 15 runs in a thrilling first over.
And the drama built yet further when Mohammed Shami, handed the new ball over Mohammed Siraj, removed Warner in a bizarre second over. Six wides a bye and a leg bye came in Shami’s over as the ball swung all over the place, with Warner wafting at one arcing away-swinger to edge to slip.
SHAMI LIFTS INDIA WITH EARLY STRIKE | CWC23
An energised crowd roared on as India pressed hard for more powerplay wickets to boost their chances of defending 240 all out.
And Bumrah stood up when his team needed him bagging his team’s second, removing the dangerous Mitchell Marsh for a run-a-ball 15, and then dismissing Steve Smith for 4.
With three of the top four back in the hutch with the score at 47/3, India had pulled themselves right back into the contest.
HEAD FIFTY GUIDES THE AUSTRALIA CHASE | CWC23
But Australia rebuilt as Travis Head and Marnus Labuschagne bedded in to lift their side.
Head led the charge as Labuschagne laid anchor at the other end, with the opener bringing up a fine fifty.
LABUSCHAGNE BRINGS UP HALF-CENTURY IN GREAT SUPPORTING ACT | CWC23
The pair's century stand left Australia in pole position to win the match, with wickets in hand and plenty of overs to spare, and Head's phenomenal century was greeted by complete silence by a shellshocked crowd at the Narendra Modi Stadium.
Australia’s bowlers light up Ahmedabad
Rohit Sharma began in his characteristic aggressive fashion, unleashing a brace of fours in the very second over, and then hitting a six and four in the fourth. Even as Josh Hazlewood was under the pump, his partner Mitchell Starc managed to strike in the fifth over. A mistimed front foot pull brought the end of Shubman Gill for four. 
ROHIT CONTINUES TO UNFURL WITH FIRST SIX OF THE FINAL | CWC23
The flow of runs didn't stop as Virat Kohli set his eye in early, and hit a hat-trick of fours against Starc. However, India's aggressive run was halted once more towards the end of the first Powerplay. Rohit mistimed a shot towards the off-side and Travis Head ran back from the covers and held on to an absolute stunner. 
KOHLI'S HAT-TRICK OF FOURS SETS THE TONE FOR INDIA | CWC23
Soon after the first Powerplay, the aggressive Shreyas Iyer also fell for a paltry score, nicking one behind the wicket. The boundaries dried up as India tried to re-settle after the early blows. They went at close to three runs an over between 11-15.
HEAD STUNNER ACCOUNTS FOR ROHIT | CWC23
Kohli and KL Rahul continued the restructuring of India's innings. Pat Cummins kept ringing in the changes amongst his bowlers to get a breakthrough, however, India managed to get to the mid-innings mark without another loss. 
On the back of Kohli's fifth successive fifty in the Cricket World Cup, India seemed to be picking up pace. However, Cummins struck once more for Australia, employing a short ball against the batter, who ended up playing on. 
HAZLEWOOD'S REVERSE SWING PROWESS GETS JADEJA | CWC23
This setback pushed India into defensive mode once more. Ravindra Jadeja, sent in at no. 6 ahead of Suryakumar Yadav to get the left-right combination going, was happy to knock the ball around the park along with Rahul. The latter reached his fifty in the 35th over mark. As the ball started to reverse swing, Australia's pacers found greater help from the wicket.
Josh Hazlewood struck in the 36th over, getting Jadeja to nick one behind the wicket. 
RAHUL'S PATIENT FIFTY KEEPS INDIA IN THE FIGHT | CWC23
India eventually reached their 200 in the 41st over. The team needed a push to get them to a solid total. 
But wickets kept on falling, and Jasprit Bumrah was next to depart, trapped in-front by Adam Zampa, who finished with 1/44 from his ten overs.
And the silence was deafening from the crowd when Hazlewood picked up the key wicket of Suryakumar Yadav, who had bided his time until the last three overs before look to go big, only to top edge one to the keeper.
The final-wicket pair looked to boost India in the death overs, and they took their team to 240 when Kuldeep Yadav was run out coming back for a second off the final ball of the innings.

Déjà vu for South Africa as semi-final post-mortem begins.docx,"South Africa’s painful record in Men’s World Cup semi-finals continues, with the record now standing at seven matches and seven defeats.
The 2023 edition of the South African semi-final story had a different feel to it, a spirited effort in defeat rather than a gut-wrenching choke perhaps.
And yet, at the same time, there are so many reasons for South African regret.
This was a team who finished second in the league standings having hammered their semi-final opponents earlier in the tournament by 134 runs.
This was also a team that had produced some of the best batting displays of the tournament, with opener Quinton de Kock finishing as one of the leading run-scorers.
AUSTRALIA OVERCOME SOUTH AFRICA FIGHT TO ENTER THE FINALS | MATCH HIGHLIGHTS | CWC23
And this was a team who got what they wanted at the toss and chose to back their batting strength in Kolkata conditions that appeared helpful to bowlers.
A three-wicket loss doesn’t quite tell the story, with South Africa recovering from 24/4 in the 12th over to reach a competitive score thanks to David Miller’s excellence.
And then with the ball it was a performance that showed spirit and heart right to the end.
But, for all of the positives, captain Temba Bavuma was left to do the interview as losing semi-final captain, for the fifth time in ODI World Cup history.
“It’s quite hard to put it into words,” Bavuma said as he spoke to Michael Atherton at Eden Gardens. “I think firstly congratulations to Australia, all the best to them in the final. They were outstanding for a large part of the game and thoroughly deserved the victory.
MILLER'S SPECTACULAR TON GETS SOUTH AFRICA TO A FIGHTING TOTAL | CWC23
“I think our character came through, that bit of resilience that we always think about. It was a bit of a dogfight.
“But looking at the result of the game, the way we started with the bat and the ball was probably the turning point, we lost it quite badly there. And we always had to play catch-up to get ourselves back into the game.”
Same, same but different
Resilience and fightbacks don’t tally well with the choker tag that South Africa are so often saddled with, and coach Rob Walter agrees that this defeat was far from being a choke.
“I mean I guess you need to define what a choke is,"" he said. ""For me, a choke is losing a game that you're in a position to win. In this instance, we were behind the eight-ball right from the word go and we actually fought our way back into the competition and put up a score that gave us a chance.
“Of course we were 30 runs or 40 runs short, but still, having them seven down and a couple of things – balls bouncing just short, a little inside edge that could have been taken.
“For me there's nothing even remotely close to a choke that happened out there today. It's a serious contest between two good teams, number two and three in the tournament.”
Right or wrong at the toss?
South Africa are a bat-first team. But faced with overcast conditions and an Australian attack featuring some serious quality with the ball, their start with the bat did not exactly go according to plan.
“I think it was the conditions combined with the quality of the attack,” Bavuma said when asked why South Africa were quite so poor in the opening 12 overs. “(Josh) Hazlewood as well as (Mitchell) Starc up front, they were ruthless.
“They exploited every bit of advantage that was presented to them with the conditions and they really put us under pressure. I think when you’re 4/24 you’re always going to struggle to get a competitive total.”
PACERS REIGN SUPREME IN OVERCAST CONDITIONS | CWC23
Should Bavuma perhaps have read conditions differently and opted to bowl first? His head coach says no - that did not tally with what anyone at the ground would have said prior to the match.
“Hindsight isn't an exact science, is it?” Walter said. “To be honest, even the commentators that I've spoken to, no one could predict how the pitch would play for the first 12 overs. And had it played as we expected it to, then we would have backed ourselves to get 270.
“You saw how much it spun in the evening – we knew that that was going to be our end into the game and ultimately it was really. We just didn't have enough runs to work with. Had those first ten overs looked a little bit different, it's easy to say at the back end of losing, but I think the contest would have been even a touch closer than it already was.”
Shamsi steps up to justify selection
The selection of Tabraiz Shamsi as an extra spinner was proved justified by an excellent performance from the spinner, who took 2/42 and very nearly did enough to spark a remarkable comeback with the ball.
Australia had looked in complete control at 60 without loss after six overs, but Shami and fellow spinners Keshav Maharaj and Aiden Markram ensured it was a tense finale at Eden Gardens.
SHAMSI TURNER RIPS PAST MAXWELL | CWC23
“We would have obviously liked to have bowled a bit better early, it allowed the other batters to play themselves in,” Bavuma said. “But Shamsi was terrific.
“We felt (the total) was competitive but we needed a lot to go right. We had chances, tough chances, that we put down. Maybe we could have been more proactive, get guys a bit closer, but you need things to go your way.”
The wait for a men’s final appearance at an ICC World Cup goes on, with attention now turning to next year’s ICC Men’s T20 World Cup in the Caribbean and USA.
"
2023 ICC Mens Cricket World Cup.docx,"The 2023 ICC Men's Cricket World Cup was the 13th edition of the Cricket World Cup, a quadrennial One Day International (ODI) cricket tournament contested by men's national teams and organised by the International Cricket Council (ICC). Ten national teams participated in the tournament, which was hosted by India. It started on 5 October and concluded on 19 November 2023, with Australia winning the tournament.[1]
It was the first men's Cricket World Cup which India hosted solely. The tournament took place in ten different stadiums, in ten cities across the country. In the first semi-final India beat New Zealand, and in the second semi-final Australia beat South Africa. The final took place between India and Australia at Narendra Modi Stadium on 19 November with Australia winning the title for the sixth time.[2]
The top eight placed teams in the tournament's final points table qualified for the 2025 ICC Champions Trophy, the next ICC ODI tournament. Virat Kohli was the player of the tournament and also scored the most runs; Mohammed Shami was the leading wicket-taker. A total of 1,250,307 spectators attended matches, the highest number in any cricket World Cup to date.[3]
Originally, the competition was to be played from 9 February to 26 March 2023.[4][5] In July 2020 it was announced that that the tournament would be moved to October and November as a result of the qualification schedule being disrupted due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[6][7] The ICC released the tournament schedule on 27 June 2023.[8][9]
The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) had threatened to boycott the competition after the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) refused to send a team to the 2023 Asia Cup scheduled in Pakistan.[10][11] This issue was resolved in June 2023 after the Asian Cricket Council announced that the competition would be hosted using a hybrid model proposed by the PCB, with nine of the 13 matches in the competition played in Sri Lanka.[12][13]
This was the first ICC World Cup in which penalties for slow over-rates were given to bowling sides if they did not complete their 50 overs in the stipulated time. On-field umpires could penalise the bowling team by not allowing more than four fielders outside the 30-yard circle.[14]
Other than India, who qualified as hosts, all teams had to qualify for the tournament through the 2023 Cricket World Cup qualification process. Afghanistan, Australia, Bangladesh, England, New Zealand, Pakistan and South Africa qualified via the ICC Cricket World Cup Super League, with the Netherlands and Sri Lanka securing the final two places via the 2023 Cricket World Cup Qualifier in Zimbabwe during June and July 2023.
As a result of the qualifying process, the competition was the first not to include former winners West Indies, who failed to progress for the first time after their defeat to Scotland.[15] Full members Ireland and Zimbabwe also missed out on qualification, meaning three of the four full members who took part in the knock-out qualification stage did not qualify, with only Sri Lanka progressing.[16] The final qualification spot was decided by an eliminator match between associate members Scotland and the Netherlands,[17] with the Dutch side taking the final place.[15]
The tournament took place in ten different stadiums, situated in ten different cities across India. The first and second semi-finals were held at Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai and Eden Gardens in Kolkata respectively, while the final took place at Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad.[8]
The BCCI provided funding for renovations and refurbishments at stadiums. Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association Stadium received a new grass surface, drainage system, seating, and hospitality boxes. Wankhede Stadium had upgrades to the outfield, floodlights, corporate boxes, and toilets. M. A. Chidambaram Stadium installed new floodlights and relaid two wickets.[18]
With the autumn scheduling of this World Cup, the ICC instituted protocols for reducing the impact of moisture—including dew and rain—on pitch conditions, so that they did not give the team batting second an advantage (as had frequently occurred in the 2021 Men's T20 World Cup). These included using a specific wetting agent, and the boundary set at around 70 m (77 yards) at each stadium, with more grass on the pitch to encourage seam bowling over spin bowling.[19]
All teams were asked to finalise their 15-player squads prior to 28 September, with any replacements after this date requiring approval from the ICC.[21] All squads were announced by 26 September 2023.[22] The oldest player of the tournament was Dutch player Wesley Barresi, who was 39 years old, while the youngest was Afghan spinner Noor Ahmad, who was 18.[23]
Match officials for the 2023 Cricket World Cup were selected by the ICC's umpire selection panel, headed by Sean Easey, the ICC's senior manager for umpires and referees. The panel selected 12 umpires to officiate at the tournament: three from Australia, four from England, four from Asia (one each from Bangladesh, India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka), two each from New Zealand and South Africa and one from the West Indies. It also selected four match referees for the event.[24][25]
Warm-up matches were held from 29 September to 3 October 2023 at Rajiv Gandhi International Cricket Stadium in Hyderabad, Assam Cricket Association Stadium in Guwahati, and Greenfield International Stadium in Thiruvananthapuram.[8]
India's warm-up fixtures were announced on 27 June. The complete warm-up fixtures were announced on 23 August.[26] The matches were broadcast live on television.[27][28]
The ICC announced the World Cup schedule on 27 June 2023 at an event in Mumbai with a countdown of 100 days to the opening match of the World Cup on 5 October. The group stage started with the match between the finalists of the 2019 Cricket World Cup, New Zealand and England, at Narendra Modi Stadium.[8] On 9 August 2023, nine fixtures, including the match between India and Pakistan, were rescheduled by the ICC.[29] The top seven teams in the tournament, excluding Pakistan who qualify automatically as host, qualified for the 2025 ICC Champions Trophy.[30]
The host India was the first team to qualify for the semi-finals after their 302-run win against Sri Lanka, their seventh successive win in the World Cup.[32] India secured the top place amongst the semi-finalists after they beat South Africa by 243 runs on 5 November at Eden Gardens in Kolkata.[33]
South Africa became the second team to qualify for the semi-finals after Pakistan defeated New Zealand on 4 November,[34] with Australia becoming the third team to qualify after defeating Afghanistan on 7 November.[35] New Zealand confirmed their berth as the fourth team after Pakistan lost their final match against England.[36]
The International Cricket Council announced the winner's trophy would tour the world 100 days before the commencement of the event. Photographs of the trophy were taken at each location. The trophy tour began with it being launched into space.[41]
The ICC officially announced the mascots for the World Cup in August. The mascots were a male and female duo named ""Tonk"" and ""Blaze"" from the fictional cricketing utopia ""Crictoverse"".[42][43]
The official theme song of the 2023 Cricket World Cup titled ""Dil Jashn Bole"" (transl. Heart say celebrate) was released on 20 September. The song was composed by Pritam, with lyrics by Shloke Lal and Saaveri Verma. The song was sung by Pritam, Nakash Aziz, Sreerama Chandra, Amit Mishra, Jonita Gandhi, Akasa Singh and S. P. Charan.[44] However, the song was subject to backlash and bad reviews.[45]
Ahead of the tournament, it was reported that an opening ceremony would take place on 4 October 2023 at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad, a day before the opening match at the same venue.[46] The ceremony was cancelled and replaced by a closing ceremony ahead of the final.[47] During this a drone show was held.[48][49]
Star Sports were the host broadcaster, televising matches domestically with Disney+ Hotstar in English and eight regional languages.[50] All matches were streamed domestically without the need for a subscription on mobile devices.[51][52][51][53] Other countries and territories had official local broadcasters for the tournament.[54]
The ICC allocated a pool of US$10 million in prize money for the tournament, with payouts remaining the same as the 2019 and 2015 tournaments. Australia, the winning team, received US$4,000,000, the runner-up $2,000,000 and the losing semi-finalists $1,600,000. Teams that did not progress past the league stage received $100,000 and the winner of each league stage match received $40,000.[55][56]"
Kohli closes in Top ODI ranking within sight for India star.docx,"Virat Kohli's push to regain the mantle as the No.1 ranked ODI player in the world has gained further momentum after the India star made good ground on the latest update to the MRF Tyres ODI Player Rankings.
Kohli scored a tournament best 765 runs during the recent ICC Men's Cricket World Cup and that helped the in-form right-hander jump one place to third on the latest rankings and within just 35 rating points of teammate Shubman Gill.
Gill (826 rating points) holds on to a narrow lead at the top of the batter rankings and Pakistan skipper Babar Azam (824) remains second, but Kohli (791) and India skipper Rohit Sharma (up one spot to fourth with 769 rating points) are now within striking distance after some strong performances during the World Cup.
AN OUTSTANDING 50TH ODI TON FROM KOHLI | CWC23
Kohli reached triple figures on three occasions at the World Cup to break the record of former teammate Sachin Tendulkar for most ODI centuries, while Rohit smashed 597 runs as the India duo finished the tournament as the two leading run scorers.
With Gill managing a reasonable output of 354 runs during the event and Babar just 320 runs as Pakistan failed to reach the knockout stages of the tournament, it paved the way for Kohli and Rohit to make their run on the top ranking.
Kohli famously held the No.1 ranking for a total of 1258 consecutive days during a reign of almost four years between 2017 and 2021, with Babar spending the majority of time in the premier position in recent years until Gill claimed top billing during the World Cup.
The rise of the India duo means South Africa opener Quinton de Kock drops two spots to fifth on the ODI batter rankings, with New Zealand right-hander Daryl Mitchell rising five spots to sixth on the back of his 552 runs at the World Cup.
COMMENTARY TEAM SELECT THEIR FAVOURITE MOMENT OF WORLD CUP | CWC23
The biggest eye-catcher on the updated ODI batter rankings is Travis Head, with the Australia opener jumping a massive 28 places to 15th overall after his brilliant century and Player of the Match performance in the World Cup final.
South Africa spinner Keshav Maharaj remains on top on the updated ODI bowler rankings, with a host of Australia players making some good ground after their successful World Cup campaign.
Experienced seamer Josh Hazlewood rises four places to second overall, fellow quick Mitchell Starc jumps eight spots to 12th, while skipper Pat Cummins improves seven rungs to 27th.
India pair Mohammed Siraj (third) and Jasprit Bumrah (fourth) remain firmly nestled within the top 10 for ODI bowlers, while teammate Kuldeep Yadav drops one spot to equal sixth.
There isn't much change inside the top 10 of the ODI rankings for all-rounders at the completion of the World Cup, with Bangladesh veteran Shakib Al Hasan maintaining a healthy lead at the head of proceedings.
New Zealand's Mitchell Santner drops two spots to seventh and Bangladesh's Mehidy Hasan Miraz rises two places to ninth.

It's for us to do it for him Rohit Sharma's rallying cry to win World Cup for Indian legend.docx,"Rohit Sharma is battle-ready for the ICC Men's Cricket World Cup 2023 Final and wants to win the silverware in honour of an Indian legend.
At the start of the tournament, India were considered favourites to go the whole way and win the ICC Men's Cricket World Cup 2023. While the tag of favourites can bog teams down, the Men in Blue have thrived on it and have gone on a sensational unbeaten run, winning all 10 games en route to the Final against Australia.
Captain Rohit Sharma has been leading by example with the bat, going all guns blazing with the bat early on to put the pressure right back on opposition teams.
RESURGENT AUSSIES UP AGAINST UNBEATEN INDIA | IT TAKES ONE DAY FINAL EPISODE | CWC23
During the press conference, Rohit Sharma pin-pointed the understated role of Rahul Dravid in India's run as well as his own batting, while emphasizing the team's determination to win the trophy in honour of the Indian legend.
""His [Dravid's] role has been absolutely massive in terms of getting that clarity which I keep talking about,"" Rohit stated. ""It's one thing for me to think about and another thing for the coach to not agree to certain things.
""Clearly, looking at how Rahul bhai himself has played his cricket and how I play these days is quite contrasting. For him to agree and give me that freedom and liberty to go and play like that says a lot about him.""
ROHIT SHARMA BREAKS MULTIPLE RECORDS WITH SUPERB CENTURY | CWC23
Under the leadership of Rohit and Dravid, India managed to make it to the semi-final of the ICC Men's T20 World Cup 2022 but fell short against England. 
The Indian captain glowingly spoke about how the coach has helped the team bounce back thereafter in the months leading to the 2023 World Cup. 
""Also the way he has stood by the players in difficult times, especially during and after the T20 World Cup,"" Rohit added. ""We had a good run up until the semi-finals and then we lost. And how he reacted to certain situations and informed the players about how we want to play says a lot about him as well.
""And obviously what he has done for Indian cricket is massive. He too feels that he wants to be a part of this big occasion. It's for us to do it for him.""
DOMINANT ENGLAND SEAL FINAL BERTH WITH EASY WIN OVER INDIA | MATCH HIGHLIGHTS | T20WC 2022
One other Indian star that has taken the tournament by storm has been Mohammed Shami. Originally not a part of India playing XI, it wasn't until the injury to Hardik Pandya during their fourth game of the tournament against Bangladesh that Shami was drafted into the team.
Since then, the right-arm pacer has been wreaking havoc game after game and despite having played only seven games, leads the wicket-takers chart (23) heading into the final.
SHAMI SIZZLES AGAIN WITH CAREER-BEST DISPLAY | POTM HIGHLIGHTS | SF1: IND V NZ | CWC23
It was a credit to Rohit Sharma and the team management that Shami managed to hit the ground running. The captain elaborated on what the chat with Shami during the initial games, as he lauded the 33-year-old for being a thorough team man.
""It was tough for him to not play the initial part of the World Cup, looking at him being one of the senior bowlers for us,"" Rohit said. ""But he was there for the team. He was there to help Siraj and Bumrah in whatever ways he could. And that shows the team man that he is.
""It was very clear, we had a chat about why he missed out and everything. And then obviously on the sidelines, he was working on his bowling. 
""Now, the results are there for everyone to see how he has come back from that. That shows the kind of mental space that Shami was in before the World Cup and even now. It's not easy not being part of the team and coming out to do the job the way he has done for us. Says a lot about him.
EVERY MOHAMMED SHAMI WICKET AT A CRICKET WORLD CUP | CWC23
""When you play a team sport, people do understand why certain players miss out on certain occasions because there's a lot that goes into getting your XI right. It depends on the conditions, the opposition and the balance that you want to create. It was just that.
""But once the opportunity opened up for him, he was ready and that we can all see with his performance.""
India will be hoping that Rohit, Shami as well as the rest of the team can produce the magic and destruction one last time. But it will certainly not be a straightforward task with Australia –  one of the few teams that managed to trouble the hosts during the league stages – standing in front of them.

Australia’s route to Cricket World Cup glory – Every game of the victorious campaign.docx,"AUSTRALIA BREAK INDIA'S UNBEATEN STREAK TO LIFT THE WORLD CUP | MATCH HIGHLIGHTS | CWC23
Pat Cummins’ side put together a brilliant performance to beat tournament hosts India in the final, completing a remarkable run of nine straight victories after Australia had lost their opening two matches.
Take a look back at a campaign that swung decisively in Australia’s favour, as the World Test Champions added the Cricket World Cup title to their trophy haul for 2023.
AUSTRALIA LIFT THE WORLD CUP FOR A RECORD SIXTH OCCASION | CWC23
Match 1, v India in Chennai: Spinners led the charge, as India made the most of a helpful surface. Useful forties from David Warner and Steve Smith ensured that Australia reached 199, a sub-par total on the wicket. However, a target of 200 seemed akin to 300 when Josh Hazlewood and Mitchell Starc struck in style to reduce India to 2/3. A solid partnership between Virat Kohli and KL Rahul stabilised the innings and helped India clinch the contest by six wickets.
Match 2, v South Africa in Lucknow: Quinton de Kock’s attacking ton set the tone for South Africa’s innings, even as substantial contributions from other batters helped them past 300. Australia floundered in response, failing to come to terms with the pace of Kagiso Rabada and Marco Jansen and  the turn of Keshav Maharaj and Tabraiz Shamsi. 
ADAM ZAMPA CLAIMS CRITICAL FOUR-WICKET HAUL AGAINST SRI LANKA | CWC23
Match 3, v Sri Lanka in Lucknow: Sri Lanka’s positive start after winning the toss saw them add 125 in no time. Australia were on the ropes for the second game in a row in the city of Nawabs, but a stunning catch from Warner turned the game around. Sri Lanka caved to the leg spin of Zampa and lost the rest of their side for merely 84 runs. Despite losing five wickets, Australia broke no sweat in what was a simple chase.
Match 4, v Pakistan in Bengaluru: An early drop proved costly for Pakistan, as Warner went on to churn out a stunning 163. Along with fellow centurion Mitchell Marsh, he helped Australia to a mammoth 367. Despite the best efforts from their top order, Pakistan were never quite in the chase.
DAVID WARNER CLUBS IMPERIOUS CENTURY AGAINST PAKISTAN | CWC23
Match 5, v Netherlands in Delhi: A northward shift in venues had little effect on Australia’s run in the tournament. They were already looking well set on their way to cross 300 at the 40th over mark when Maxwell arrived to blaze the fastest ton in the history of the tournament. This helped Australia finish on 399. A Zampa-led bowling effort then cleaned up Netherlands for 90, to give Australia a 309-run win. This remains the largest winning margin by runs in the history of the event.
Match 6, v New Zealand in Dharamsala: Australia went further north to the high altitudes of Dharamsala, and their total reached similar heights on the back of a sizzling ton from Travis Head. Rachin Ravindra and James Neesham nearly pulled it off for the Kiwis, but eventually, Australia overcame their trans-Tasman rivals by five runs. 
AUSTRALIA OVERCOME NEW ZEALAND CHALLENGE IN RUN-FEST CLASSIC | MATCH HIGHLIGHTS | CWC23
Match 7, v England in Ahmedabad: An early stumble against the old rivals was overcome by a crucial stand between Marnus Labuschagne and Cameron Green before a Zampa cameo helped Australia finish at 286. A brief threat from Dawid Malan, Ben Stokes, and Moeen Ali was overcome by the excellence of Zampa. The leg-spinner finished with 3/21.
Match 8, v Afghanistan in Mumbai: Led by an inspirational ton from Ibrahim Zadran, Afghanistan finished at 291/5. Their bowlers then came into the contest big time, reducing Australia to 91/7. 

EVERY SIX AS GLENN MAXWELL BLASTS ASTONISHING DOUBLE HUNDRED | CWC23
Glenn Maxwell rose to the occasion to play one of the greatest ODI innings of all time. Battling severe cramps, he smashed a double century, hitting 21 fours and 10 sixes in a masterpiece that helped Australia cross the line with three wickets in hand.
Match 9, v Bangladesh in Pune: Bangladesh batted first and racked up a strong total on a good batting wicket. However, Mitchell Marsh’s blazing 177* overcame that effort from the Tigers.
Semi-final 2, v South Africa in Kolkata: Just like in their opening encounter, Australia’s pacers fired with the new ball and cleaned up the Proteas top-order. A brilliant century from David Miller helped South Africa post 212. 
A characteristic attacking start from Warner and Head put Australia ahead before South Africa tweakers made things even. Eventually, the tail withstood the spinners and Gerald Coetzee’s splendid spell to take them home by three wickets.
TRAVIS HEAD REFLECTS ON SEMI-FINAL THRILLER | CWC23
Final, v India in Ahmedabad: Australia delivered a near-perfect performance right from the moment that Pat Cummins won the toss and took a gamble on bowling first against India's talent-packed batting line-up.
The bowling attack responded brilliantly to a powerplay that saw 80 runs flow, equalling the record for a World Cup Final. Australia's experienced unit heaped on pressure with the ball, picking up key wickets at important moments, with the fielding effort matching the bowlers' standards.
Chasing a target of 241 under lights and on a difficult surface should have been a challenge, particularly after three wickets fell inside the first seven overs. But Australia's composure under pressure is one of the key qualities of this group of players, and Travis Head's century and Marnus Labuschagne's calm and composed half-century led the team to victory.
AN AMAZING WORLD CUP WINNING TON | CWC23
Head was deservedly named Player of the Match, but from one to 11 it was an Australian showing that saw them add a sixth men's Cricket World Cup title to the nation's honours.

A tournament of wonders All the records that broke at the Cricket World Cup 2023.docx,"
From its initial days, the ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup 2023 was a statistical wonder as a number of records were set during the event.
Many team and individual milestones from previous editions of the World Cup were shattered, and new records were set during the ICC Men's Cricket World Cup 2023. 
From South Africa’s attacking first innings play to Glenn Maxwell’s masterpiece at Wankhede to Virat Kohli’s prolific run, the tournament had it all. 
The competitive nature of the event showed in an unusual record – the tournament became the first instance where every participating team managed to win at least two games each. 
Here are the key records created at the Cricket World Cup 2023 in India.
Australia - The most successful team in terms of final appearances and wins
When Australia took the podium at the Narendra Modi stadium, the side was lifting the trophy for a record sixth occasion. Their first-ever win in the tournament came in 1987 when Allan Border’s men downed England in a close contest at the Eden Gardens.
INSIDE THE AUSSIE DRESSING ROOM | CWC23 FINAL
They went on to win the trophy in 1999, 2003, 2007, and 2015 before completing a full circle in India in 2023. This makes them the most successful side in the tournament. In fact, the only other teams with more than one triumph in the tournament are West Indies (1975, 1979) and India (1983, 2011). 
With eight appearances in 13 finals, they have also featured in the most finals in the tournament. India and England come joint-second with four appearances each. 
Travis Head - Only the second centurion in a Cricket World Cup final chase
Travis Head’s magnificent 137 helped Australia charge towards a sixth World Cup triumph. He was the seventh centurion in a World Cup final, becoming the second player after Sri Lanka’s Aravinda de Silva to ton up in a chase.
AN AMAZING WORLD CUP WINNING TON | CWC23
De Silva’s 107* led the island nation to triumph against Australia in 1996. 
Virat Kohli - Most runs in a single edition of the Men's Cricket World Cup (765 runs) 
Though his team didn’t end up with the trophy, Kohli was among the finest performers in the tournament. He finished as the highest run-getter with 765 runs at an average of 95.62. 
This helped him overtake Sachin Tendulkar’s record of 673 runs, which was set in India’s World Cup run of 2003. 
Virat Kohli - Most centuries in ODIs (50)
During this tournament, Kohli also became the batter with the most ODI hundreds. Here too, he overtook his idol Tendulkar, who was the previous record holder with 49 tons to his name. 
KOHLI OVERTAKES TENDULKAR LANDMARK | CWC23
Kohli began the tournament with 47 ODI hundreds. He reached his 48th century against Bangladesh in Pune with a 103* in a successful chase. He equaled Tendulkar at Eden Gardens against South Africa. The unbeaten 101* laid the foundation for a massive 243-run win. 
Finally, in the World Cup semi-final against New Zealand in Mumbai, Kohli smashed his 50th ODI hundred at the Wankhede, scoring 117 from 113 balls.
South Africa - Highest total by a side in a World Cup game (428) and most hundreds in a single edition (nine)
South Africa announced their presence at the World Cup in style, blazing off to 428/5 against Sri Lanka. Quinton de Kock, Rassie van der Dussen, and Aiden Markram hit tons during Proteas' exceptional innings. 
Markram also clubbed his ODI hundred off merely 49-balls, which at the time was the fastest World Cup hundred.
BATTERS SHINE AND RECORDS FALL AS SOUTH AFRICA BEAT SRI LANKA | MATCH HIGHLIGHTS | CWC23
This was the highest-ever score in a Cricket World Cup game, overtaking Australia’s 417/6 against Afghanistan in 2015. This was also South Africa’s third-highest total in ODIs. 
Temba Bavuma’s side had nine individual hundreds which is also now the most for a team in a single edition.
The Proteas also became the first team to score four 350-plus scores in a single World Cup edition. They hit 99 sixes in this World Cup, which was the most by a team in a single edition. 
Mohammed Shami - Fastest-ever to 50 wickets in World Cup (17 innings)
It was only after an injury to Hardik Pandya that Mohammed Shami got an opportunity to feature for India. And he began in style, with a match-winning five-wicket haul against New Zealand. 
SHAMI SWINGS IT INDIA'S WAY IN WANKHEDE | CWC23
During his exceptional run, he picked 24 wickets at an average of 10.7, which is the third-best in a single edition of the World Cup. 
He took merely 17 innings to reach the overall haul of 50 wickets in the World Cup, making him the fastest-ever bowler to reach the landmark. The pacer is also the first bowler to record three five-fors in a single World Cup edition. 
Rohit Sharma - Most centuries at the Cricket World Cup (seven)
India skipper Rohit Sharma was at his belligerent best during the World Cup. His selfless batting was often the foundation of strong match-winning totals. In his prolific run, which saw him score 597 runs at an average of 54.27 and a strike rate of 125.94, Rohit also managed to score a century. 
RECORDS CRUSHED AS ROHIT SHARMA MAKES BLAZING CENTURY | POTM HIGHLIGHTS | CWC23
His match-winning 131 against Afghanistan was his seventh Cricket World Cup century. He became the leading century-maker in the World Cups, surpassing Tendulkar (6) in the process. 
With 31 ODI tons, he’s now third on the list of all-time century makers in the format. 
Thanks to his hard-hitting approach, Rohit became the first player to hit more than 50 sixes in the tournament, with a total of 54 maximums to his name. 
Glenn Maxwell - Fastest-ever century in the Cricket World Cup (40 balls)
Markram’s record for the fastest Cricket World Cup hundred stood only for a few days, as Australia’s all-rounder Maxwell blazed to a stunning century against the Netherlands. Maxwell hit nine fours and eight sixes en route his match-winning hundred. 
MAXWELL SPARKS AUSTRALIA WITH RECORD-BREAKING KNOCK | CWC23
Mohammed Shami - Best ODI bowling figures by an Indian (7/57)
Shami was instrumental in India’s win over New Zealand in their semi-final at Wankhede. His seven-wicket haul led to Kiwis' downfall as they slipped from 220/2 to 327 all out.
SHAMI SIZZLES AGAIN WITH CAREER-BEST DISPLAY | POTM HIGHLIGHTS | SF1: IND V NZ | CWC23
These were the best-ever figures by an Indian bowler in ODIs. The previous record was held by Stuart Binny, who had picked 6/4 against Bangladesh in 2014. 
Glenn Maxwell - First-ever double century in an ODI chase
The miracle of Maxwell continued in the tournament, as the star performer unleashed an all-time great ODI innings against Afghanistan in Mumbai. 
EPIC MONTAGE OF GLENN MAXWELL'S INCREDIBLE DOUBLE HUNDRED | CWC23
Arriving at 49/4, he soon saw his side slide to 91/7 in pursuit of 292. Then battling severe cramps against a pumped up bowling line-up, he unleashed a masterclass for the ages.
His double hundred was the first by an Australian in ODIs and the second-fastest double ton ever. It was also the first time a double century was scored in a chase. This was also the highest score from someone coming in at number six or lower position.
Other prominent records made during CWC23
- Kohli stands 152 runs away from 14,000 runs in ODIS. He surpassed Sri Lanka's Sanath Jayasuriya and Australia's Ricky Ponting to become the third-highest run-getter in ODI history during the event.
- Kohli is the second-highest run-getter in ICC Men’s World Cup history with 1,795 runs, behind Tendulkar. 
- Australia's Mitchell Starc surpassed Pakistan's Wasim Akram and Sri Lanka's Lasith Malinga to become the third-highest wicket-taker in the history of the Cricket World Cup. He has 65 wickets to his name. 
- South Africa's Quinton de Kock finished with 594 runs in this World Cup. This is the highest runs tally by a wicketkeeper batter in a single World Cup edition. He also became the first player in the cricketing history to score 500 runs and affect 20 or more dismissals in a World Cup.
- Rohit Sharma and David Warner became the joint-fastest players to reach 1000 runs in World Cups. Both batters took 19 innings to reach the landmark.
- Haris Rauf had an ignominious record to his name after conceding 533 runs in the tournament. No other bowler has conceded more in a single edition.
- Adam Zampa ended the World Cup with 23 wickets to his name, which is the joint-most wickets taken by a spinner, equalling Muttiah Muralitharan.

The biggest game changers on the field during the Cricket World Cup 2023.docx,"Aprolific duo from the World Champions Australia had the maximum impact on the field during the ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup 2023.
Australia’s Marnus Labuschagne and David Warner take the top two positions in the ICC Fielding Impact Ratings. These ratings are done in collaboration with Sportradar.
Their compatriot Glenn Maxwell is placed at No. 9 in the ratings as Australia emerged as the most dominant side on the field. Their exceptional fielding backed the sharp work of their bowlers and helped restrict the opponents to manageable targets. This was especially useful during the knockout stages when Australia succeeded in chases.
AUSTRALIA THROW THEMSELVES AROUND TO SAVE CRUCIAL RUNS | CWC23
Labuschange and Warner lead the pack
Labuschagne was the most successful fielder of the tournament, with 82.66 Fielding Impact Rating points to his name. However, his eight catches weren’t the most in the tournament for out-fielders with New Zealand’s Daryl Mitchell leading that pack with 11 takes to his name.  
INSIDE THE AUSSIE DRESSING ROOM | CWC23 FINAL
Marnus' efforts included runs saved (15), run out (one), assisted run outs (three, the most for any player in the tournament), and good throws (three) among other factors. 
Closely placed in the second position was Warner with 82.55 points to his name. Like Labuschagne, he took eight catches but saved as many as 23 runs on the field. 
South Africa’s David Miller came in third place with 79.48 points, while India all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja was fourth with 72.72 points. Netherlands’ Sybrand Engelbrecht came fifth for his exceptional work for the Dutch. India's star batter Virat Kohli, who hit a record 765 runs in the tournament, also shined in the field with 56.79 points. He took six catches and saved seven runs. 
AUSTRALIA WIN LOW-SCORING SEMI-FINAL THRILLER | DIGITAL DAILY: EPISODE 47 | CWC23
World Cup winners Australia topped the fielding charts
The World Champions were by far the best side on the pitch, with 383.58 cumulative team points, and 34.87 points garnered per game. They had the highest catch efficiency (74.19%), with 62 catches taken for 16 dropped catches.
The runner-ups India came in at fourth place behind South Africa and the Netherlands. They had 281.04 points and a catch efficiency of 72. "
"Australia great lauds Head, Cummins after dominant World Cup triumph.docx","Two-time World Cup winner Shane Watson has led the praise of Travis Head and Pat Cummins after Australia's ICC Men's Cricket World Cup victory over India in Ahmedabad.
Despite a relatively quick start from India with the bat, and in front of a huge crowd inside the Narendra Modi Stadium, an unflustered Australia held their nerve.
Pat Cummins kept his calm in the heat of battle to rein in his rivals through smart bowling changes and 2/34 himself, though it was his boldness of deploying Glenn Maxwell early in Australia's bowling innings that proved to swing proceedings, a move backed by Head, who would go on to have a career day.
INSIDE THE AUSSIE DRESSING ROOM | CWC23 FINAL
Taking a superb catch running into the outfield to dismiss the dangerous Rohit Sharma (47 from 31 balls) and wrestle momentum, Head kickstarted Australia's push to keep the hosts to 241.
Opening the batting in Australia's reply, Head then survived a tricky early period against an imperious fast bowling attack to finish with 137 (120) to his name, taking Australia from 47/3 to 239/4 with Marnus Labuschagne (58*) inside 43 over, all but taking Australia to victory.
Head watched on as Maxwell hit the winning runs, before being crowned Player of the Match for his exploits.
Speaking on the latest episode of The ICC Review podcast with host Brian Murgatroyd after Australia's sixth Cricket World Cup title, Watson lauded the opening batter's continued aggression when so many others would have crept into their shell.
""There's no question that he's a high risk, high reward batter. He takes the game on,"" Watson noted.
""Once he finds his groove, as we saw after probably about 50 or 60 runs, then he was just in overdrive. And then he was just really in, whenever he wanted to hit the ball to the boundary he did."" 
AUSTRALIA BREAK INDIA'S UNBEATEN STREAK TO LIFT THE WORLD CUP | MATCH HIGHLIGHTS | CWC23
Australia's slow start at the tournament undoubtedly coincided with Head's absence, having missed time with a fracture in his left hand. Kept in the squad by selectors and coach Andrew McDonald, Head repaid team management.
He stormed back into form with a century on his return against New Zealand during group stage action, before Player of the Month performances in the semi-final against South Africa and in Sunday's trophy-claiming victory.
Watson was quick to acknowledge how important it was for him to make immediate impact given his importance to the team's balance.
""With no cricket to be had, to come into a World Cup, getting a hundred against a high-quality New Zealand bowling attack, and then to be able to replicate that in a semi-final against South Africa. The firepower that he possesses. And then the final,"" Watson began.
""There's no question that Travis Head in the way he's really reformed himself as a player and as a performer for Australia across all formats of the game has been just through that freedom and fearless way that he's been playing.
""He's been a revelation for Australia at the top of the order for sure. The way he's been batting in one day cricket and we had to do it in India in a final, in challenging conditions, one the atmosphere for sure, but these conditions here today certainly were fairly different to what he's used to batting in Australia, for example, and where he got brought up.
""To be able to do that in these conditions as well as shows something of a very, very high quality."" 
HEAD HITS EXCEPTIONAL TON IN WORLD CUP FINAL | CWC23
Watson missed out on the Australian 2003 tournament victory through a back injury, though proved to be a key member of the side's victorious 2007 and 2015 campaigns.
Even looking back with rose-tinted glasses of yesteryear, Watson admitted he'd never seen an Australian team win like the one on Sunday.
""With my experience, watching the 1999 World Cup, then watching from afar 2003 and the others in 2007 and 2015, to be able to win here in India, playing India in the final and knowing these conditions, they were going to be as extreme as India could possibly make them,"" Watson said.
""For Australia to be able to win this World Cup here in India with the support, and things going against Pat Cummins, he's just done it, made the transition so easily.""
AUSTRALIA LIFT THE WORLD CUP FOR A RECORD SIXTH OCCASION | CWC23
Cummins came under question after two early defeats to begin the tournament, even in spite of claiming a World Test Championship Final victory, and successfully retaining the Ashes in England.
Watson, who stepped up to take up the Australian captaincy on an interim basis during his career, saluted Cummins' cool.
""The decisions he made today, his tactics were absolutely spot on,"" Watson said.
""His ability to be able to galvanise his team and whatever they did to turn things around after that second game, the coach, the support staff and Pat Cummins in the leadership group of the Australian team, whatever they did, they really turned it around and turned it on.
""To be able to then just work through it, and you could see there definitely was a shift after the second game just from his own performance, you'd see there's a little bit of extra intensity in him after that.
""He's not an experienced captain, even coming into this World Cup, he’d only captained Australia in one day in a handful of occasions.""

Babar Azam resigns as Pakistan captain in all formats.docx,"Pakistan’s Babar Azam has stepped down as captain across all formats of the game following the team’s league-stage exit at the ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup 2023.
The Pakistan Cricket Board have subsequently announced that Shaheen Shah Afridi will take over as T20I captain and Shan Masood will be the Pakistan Test captain. A decision on the ODI captaincy will be made in due course.
The PCB also confirmed that there will be a sizeable change to the coaching staff heading into the tours of Australia and New Zealand in the coming months.
""The PCB has changed the portfolio of the entire coaching staff including Director Cricket Mickey Arthur,"" a statement read. ""All coaches will continue to work in National Cricket Academy while PCB will announce the new coaching staff in due course for the upcoming series in Australia and New Zealand.""
Babar has been the multi-format Pakistan captain since 2020, taking on the ODI and Test roles a year after he took charge of the T20 side.
But Pakistan’s disappointing campaign at the ongoing Cricket World Cup in India has led to the 29-year-old stepping down with immediate effect.
“I vividly remember the moment when I received the call from PCB to lead Pakistan in 2019,” Babar said in a statement released on his social media channels.
“Over the past four years, I've experienced many highs and lows on and off the field, but I wholeheartedly and passionately aimed to maintain Pakistan's pride and respect in the cricket world.
“Reaching the number 1 spot in the white-ball format was a result of the collective efforts of players, coaches, and management, but I'd like to express my gratitude to passionate Pakistan cricket fans for their unwavering support during this journey.
“Today, I am stepping down as the captain of Pakistan in all formats. It's a difficult decision but I feel it is a right time for this call.""
Pakistan lost five matches during the 2023 tournament, finishing outside of the semi-final qualification places. And Babar was largely off form with the bat, scoring 320 runs in his nine innings and having a top score of just 74.
The former top-ranked ODI batter in the world, who averages 56.72 in the format with 19 centuries to his name, says he will continue to be available to play for Pakistan in all formats going forward and will offer his support to whoever takes over as skipper.
INDECISIVE PULL ENDS BABAR'S CAMPAIGN | CWC23
“I will continue to represent Pakistan as a player in all three formats. I am here to support the new captain and the team with my experience and dedication.
“I want to express my sincere thanks to the Pakistan Cricket Board for entrusting me with this significant responsibility.”
ENGLAND END ON A HIGH AS PAKISTAN SLIP TO DEFEAT | MATCH HIGHLIGHTS | CWC23
The PCB say that Babar ""was asked to continue as Test captain"" after being relieved of his duties in the white-ball formats, but opted to step down across all formats.
“Babar Azam is truly a world-class player and we want him to continue to thrive as a player,"" Zaka Ashraf, Chairman of the PCB Management Committee, said. ""He is one of the best batters Pakistan has ever produced. He is our asset, and we will continue to support him. His batting prowess is a testament to his dedication and skill. He is a role model for the present generation.
“We want to see him grow as a great batter and now without his additional burden of the captaincy, he can focus more on his performances to reach even greater heights. We respect his decision and will continue to back him.”

India star named Player of the Tournament at ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup.docx,"India’s run-scoring machine Virat Kohli has been named the ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup 2023 Player of the Tournament.
Kohli’s brilliance with the bat was a defining feature of the tournament, with India’s number three scoring at least a half-century in nine of his 11 innings.
AN OUTSTANDING 50TH ODI TON FROM KOHLI | CWC23
His 765 runs in the tournament is the most ever scored by an individual batter at a men’s Cricket World Cup, surpassing the previous record set by Sachin Tendulkar, who hit 673 in the 2003 tournament.
Kohli finished with an average of 95.62 and a strike rate of 90.31 in the tournament, hitting three centuries along the way – against Bangladesh and South Africa in the league stage and then once more against New Zealand in the semi-finals.
That third century took Kohli’s career tally to 50 One Day International hundreds, making him the leading century-maker in the history of the format.
Kohli broke Tendulkar’s long-standing record at the ‘Little Master’s’ home ground, the Wankhede Stadium, and said that it was the perfect moment.
""This all feels like a dream,"" Kohli said after his 117 steered India to the final.
KOHLI DETAILS HIS RECORD CENTURY | CWC23
""If I could paint the perfect picture, I would want this to be the picture. My life partner, the person I love the most, she is sitting there. My hero Sachin is sitting there. I was able to get the 50th in front of them and these fans in such a historic venue. It’s amazing.""
Kohli finished his tournament with yet another half-century, hitting 54 from 63 balls against Australia in the final. But his efforts proved in vain as India missed out on victory, falling at the final hurdle.
"
India retain pride in defeat after tournament to remember.docx,"India coach Rahul Dravid says he is exceptionally proud of all of his players, singling out captain Rohit Sharma for particular praise, after the team’s run to the final of the ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup 2023.
India won 10 straight matches to reach the final on home soil, but were beaten on the day by an Australian side who delivered in all facets of the game to run out winners by six wickets.
But India’s head coach was still full of pride in his team's efforts across the whole campaign.
“We ran a really good campaign,” Dravid said. “I’m really proud of the boys, the way we played right through this tournament, the kind of cricket we played, just the quality of cricket that we played right through this tournament, I thought was quite exceptional. So really proud of the efforts, proud of everything that we gave.
“Just at the last step in the final we probably didn't have our best game and credit to Australia. My congratulations to them. They played really well on the day and they were better than us.”

Captain Rohit finished the campaign as the second-highest scorer, setting the tone at the top of the innings.
And out on the field his captaincy was notably excellent, with Dravid saying that he couldn’t have asked for any more from his skipper.
“I think he's been an exceptional leader,” the coach said. “You know, Rohit's really led this team fantastically well, I think he's certainly got the dressing room. I just think he's given so much of his time and energy in the dressing room to the boys.
ROHIT SHARMA BREAKS MULTIPLE RECORDS WITH SUPERB CENTURY | CWC23
“He's always been available for any of our conversations, any of our meetings. Sometimes there's been a lot of planning, a lot of strategy that goes in. He's always committed to those things. He's given a lot of his personal time, energy into this campaign.
“And his batting as well, I thought it was fantastic, the way he set the tone for us. We knew that we wanted to play a certain way. We wanted to play a positive attacking brand of cricket. And he was very committed to doing that. And he wanted to lead by example. And I thought right through the tournament, he was quite superb in doing that. I just can't speak more highly of him as a person and as a leader.”
DISCIPLINED AUSTRALIA TAKE CONTROL AFTER EARLY BLAZE | INNINGS HIGHLIGHTS | CWC23
A disappointing slide with the bat saw India go from 80/2 after the Powerplay in the final to 240 all out, struggling to unleash the shackles against an Australian bowling attack that kept things extremely tight during the middle overs.
Dravid said it wasn’t necessarily a tactic for India to slow down the tempo to the extent that they did, pointing to Australia’s excellence with the ball and the loss of wickets at key times as the reason that his team fell short of a target that would have been more competitive on the day.
“In hindsight, I think we fell about 30-40 runs short. It's not that we were looking to bat it out. I thought they bowled well through that period. I thought it just felt like the ball was stopping in the afternoon a little bit more than it did in the evening. And not that there was a lot of dew, to be honest, but just felt like the ball came on to the bat a lot better in the evening,"" Dravid added.
BOUNDARY FOLLOWED BY RUNOUT IN EXCITING FINAL OVER | CWC23
“We were rotating the strike, but we weren't able to hit those boundaries. And yeah, there was a conscious effort to try and take the game deep, but we kept losing wickets. We just lost wickets just when we felt that we built a partnership and we can start going. We lost a wicket, we lost Virat (Kohli), then we lost Jaddu (Jadeja) and then we lost (KL) Rahul. So, we just kept losing wickets at critical intervals and probably felt that we were about 40 runs short.
“I mean, I know in the end it looked like they would have chased even 40 runs more. But if we had got to 280, 290, and they were 60 for 3, then it might have been a very different game.”
India’s wait for victory at a major men’s ICC event goes on, with their 2011 Cricket World Cup triumph and 2013 ICC Champions Trophy success now seeming a very long time ago.
But, in contrast to some of the nation’s previous losses, Dravid says this defeat was not a case of the occasion or pressure getting to the team.
“I didn't feel at any stage going into this game that there were any nerves or the guys were intimidated by the game or they were concerned about the game. I think they were looking forward to it we were excited about the game,"" he said.
""I thought there was energy and the mental space the boys were in leading into this particular game was spot-on was terrific. Just on the day we probably didn't execute, and Australia played better than us.”
INSIDE THE AUSSIE DRESSING ROOM | CWC23 FINAL
As for Dravid’s future, he refused to be drawn on the subject at this stage.
“I was completely focused on this campaign, focused on this World Cup, and there was nothing else on my mind. And I haven't given any other thought to what happens in the future,"" the coach said.
India’s men return to action in just four days’ time for a T20I series against Australia.

Australian greats reach ‘the pinnacle’ in a year for the ages.docx,"This Australian team are a phenomenal group of cricketers, excelling across formats and conditions, with this latest triumph underlining their status as one of the great teams of any era.
Victory in the ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup 2023 comes six months after their ICC World Test Championship triumph, with the small matter of retaining the Ashes in between. Add in the 2021 ICC T20 World Cup win that many of the same group of players featured in, and this crop of Australian cricketers have pulled themselves up to the level of all-time greats of the game.

AUSTRALIA BREAK INDIA'S UNBEATEN STREAK TO LIFT THE WORLD CUP | MATCH HIGHLIGHTS | CWC23
This is a team that has it all – power at the top of the order, quality with the bat through the middle, all-rounder options, a brilliant seam attack, a hugely effective spinner. And let’s not forget the strength of the fielding unit, which delivered in some style in Sunday’s World Cup final to keep the pressure up on India.
It really says something when Pat Cummins describes this latest glory as the best and biggest yet.
“I think it’s the pinnacle of international cricket, winning a one-day World Cup. Especially over here in India, in front of a crowd like this,"" a beaming Australian captain said after his team's wonderful win in Ahmedabad.
“It’s been a big year for everyone, but our cricket team has been here in India, the Ashes, World Test Championship and to top it off with this is just huge and these are the moments that you'll remember for the rest of your life.
“You only get a shot at it every four years. Even if you have a 10-year career, you might only get two chances at it. Just the whole cricket world stops with this World Cup. So, it doesn't get any better.”
INSIDE THE AUSSIE DRESSING ROOM | CWC23 FINAL
Strength and conditioning played a big role too, not least in the occasionally sweltering conditions that Australia were met with during the course of their campaign.
The wider staff did a superb job to ensure that the squad (one that was far from the youngest in the tournament and was carrying a few knocks) managed to peak at just the right moment.
There are few finer examples of that than Travis Head, who was backed to recover from a broken hand during the first half of the tournament before taking his place in the squad for the back end.
The physios worked their magic, Head buckled down, and the result was that Australia benefitted from a player hitting top form at just the right moment.
Back-to-back top scores and Player of the Match awards in both the semi-final and final – it doesn’t get much better than that.
AN AMAZING WORLD CUP WINNING TON | CWC23
“Travis Head was phenomenal,” Cummins enthused. “I think a lot of credit should also go to Andrew McDonald and George Bailey, the selectors, to take a punt. He had a broken finger, a broken hand, for half of the tournament, but to keep him in the squad was a huge risk. And the medical team were fantastic, obviously, to get him into a place where he could perform.
“That was a big risk, I think we could have been made to look really silly if that didn't pay off, but you've got to take those risks to win a tournament. And Trav, the player we've seen in Test cricket, he just epitomises everything I want out of a cricket team. He takes the game on, he plays with a smile, he just puts the pressure right back onto the opposition and he's just great fun to be around. So, I couldn't be happier for Trav.”
Australia’s celebrations were well and truly underway up in the locker room as captain Cummins finished off his media responsibilities for the day, with the party expected to last well into the week.
But, back home, millions of Australians, those who didn’t stay up through the night, will wake to the news of their team’s latest achievement. And Cummins says he always remains massively appreciative of all those at home who have supported the team, not least those closest to the players.
“I mean at this moment I'm just incredibly proud really of the year we've had. I know my family at home is watching, I just got a message from Dad saying he's had a lot of 4ams, not going to bed until 4am, so he's as pumped as anything.
“You sacrifice a lot to play for Australia, everyone in the team has, and we've spent a lot of this year away. But we do it for these moments. My wife and two girls are probably asleep, hopefully asleep, but they're all pumped, they do the journey with us. So, everyone's got their own story, but there's a lot of proud people out there in our team.”
Everyone does have their own story. In Pat Cummins’ story, 2023 will make for one hell of a chapter.

Led by Rohit Sharma’s belligerence and Virat Kohli’s assurance, the batting unit has clicked in all their games so far. Mohammed Shami’s excellence has led their bowling effort, which has seen both the pacers and spinners thrive.Match 1, v Australia in Chennai: Spinners led the charge, as India made the most of a helpful surface. Useful knocks from David Warner and Steve Smith ensured that Australia reached 199, a sub-par total on the wicket.  However, a target of 200 seemed akin to 300 when Josh Hazlewood and Mitchell Starc struck in style to reduce India to 2/3.

Rohit’s attacking ton then led India's chase, as the target was chased down in merely 35 overs.

The Men in Blue produced a clinical performance with the ball in the first innings, although they suffered the loss of Hardik Pandya who injured himself in this game. The all-rounder was subsequently ruled out of the tournament.   Match 5, v New Zealand in Dharamsala: India’s first non-Asian opponent in three games also proved to be their most challenging competitor thus far. Daryl Mitchell and Rachin Ravindra seemed to be running away with the game at one stage, having blunted India’s spin attack.  However, Shami, the man who had replaced Pandya in the India lineup, stood up and delivered with a scintillating five-for. From 178/2, New Zealand slipped to 273 all out.

But Markram’s situation was different for a few reasons.  In this case, a short ball from Haris Rauf whistled past Markram and bounced just before reaching Rizwan. The keeper bowed his head towards the turf upon receiving the ball.  Play Video Play  Mute Remaining Time -5:17  Picture-in-Picture  Fullscreen SOUTH AFRICA OVERCOME SPIRITED PAKISTAN BY ONE WICKET | MATCH HIGHLIGHTS | CWC23 At the same time, Markram tapped his foot in the crease and walked up the wicket. Rizwan under-armed the ball back towards the direction of both the wickets and Rauf, and when the ball struck the stumps, Markram was well out of his ground.  Here’s why the South African was not given out:  No appeal The umpires were left with no decision to make because Rizwan and none of the Pakistan team appealed.  If they had appealed, then the match officials would certainly have had to have looked at replays.  The ball was (probably) dead Had Pakistan appealed, then that would have muddied the waters as to whether the fielding side believed the ball to be in play or not.  Playing Conditions: ICC Men's Cricket World Cup 2023 A batter cannot be run out when a ball is considered dead. In the Bairstow run-out at Lord’s, even though the batter considered the over to be finished, the ball was not dead because wicket-keeper Alex Carey had intentionally thrown the ball back towards the stumps in virtually the same motion as receiving it.  There are a number of laws around dead ball. The Playing Conditions for the ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup 2023 are consistent with those, and relevant laws state:  - “The ball becomes dead when it is finally settled in the hands of the wicket-keeper or of the bowler.”  - “The ball shall be considered to be dead when it is clear to the bowler’s end umpire that the fielding side and both batters at the wicket have ceased to regard it as in play.”  - “Whether the ball is finally settled or not is a matter for the umpire alone to decide.”  Play Video Play  Mute Remaining Time -4:22  Picture-in-Picture  Fullscreen NAIL-BITER ENDS IN SOUTH AFRICA TRIUMPH OVER PAKISTAN | DIGITAL DAILY: EPISODE 26 | CWC23 Markram tapped his boot in the crease before leaving, which many batters do to signal that they are not making a run. But that alone doesn’t make the ball dead. It simply illustrates that the batter considers the ball dead.  The decision in this case would have been whether the ball was “settled” in Rizwan’s gloves.   It's impossible to know for sure, but the dipping of his head and the length of time between Rizwan receiving the ball and throwing it back in the direction of the stumps means that the umpires would almost certainly have ruled the ball dead even had Pakistan appealed.  As it was, the umpires replaced the bails, both teams smiled, the crowd cheered, and everybody moved on."""

His willow didn't yield the same fire for the next few games but eventually, against Bangladesh, he bludgeoned a stunning 174, during which he walloped 15 fours and seven sixes.   His final ton in the group stage came against New Zealand in Pune. He gave South Africa the best possible start with his 114 after they were sent in to bat by New Zealand.

Shami thundered into the tournament, claiming three of New Zealand's top four to finish with figures of 5/54 from 10 overs. England looked bereft of answers in his spell of 4/22 in Lucknow, and the quick was unplayable in India's rout of Sri Lanka, finishing with 5/18.

First, Maxwell's heroics with the bat against The Netherlands and Afghanistan rightly stand out above his other achievements. Making the fastest ever Cricket World Cup hundred (40) balls against the Dutch, he somehow outdid his own headline-grabbing moment at the tournament, bring Australia back from the dead at 49/4 and 91/7 chasing 292 against the Afghans.  Not only fighting the situation and Afghanistan's highly-skilled attack, Maxwell also flourished in spite of the Mumbai heat, fighting through cramps and pain on the way to the first double century in a men's ODI chase, and becoming the first Australian man to achieve the feat in the format.   After his efforts, neither South Africa or a potential opponent in the tournament final will write Australia off if Maxwell is still playing a part.

Going at less than four an over, bowling a large percentage of his overs with the new ball, Bumrah has stifled oppositions eager to go hard in the Powerplay. His wicket-taking prowess also stands out, with his run of wicket-taking games only ending in India's eighth match against South Africa.

Finalists dominate Cricket World Cup Team of the Tournament.docx,"""The ICC Men‚Äôs Cricket World Cup 2023 delivered some phenomenal individual performances across seven weeks of high-class international action, and here is the official ICC Team of the Tournament.

1. Quinton de Kock (South Africa) (wk)
South Africa‚Äôs opener was in breath-taking form during the group stage, scoring four centuries, including an enormous 174 against Bangladesh at the Wankhede Stadium.
Quinton de Kock scored 594 runs at a strike rate of 107.02 across the tournament, with only Indian pair Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli scoring more.
2. Rohit Sharma (India) (c)
The India captain and opener set the tone at the top of the order for the hosts, hitting 597 runs, with only his teammate Virat Kohli scoring more.
ROHIT SHARMA BREAKS MULTIPLE RECORDS WITH SUPERB CENTURY | CWC23
Rohit‚Äôs tally is the seventh-highest ever at a men‚Äôs Cricket World Cup, 51 runs short of his own best effort at the 2019 tournament in England.
The nature of the opener‚Äôs runs was even more crucial than their volume, with his strike-rate of 125.94 being the highest of any top-four batter in the tournament. Only Glenn Maxwell and Heinrich Klassen scored at a quicker rate among the World Cup‚Äôs recognised specialist batters.

3. Virat Kohli (India)
Virat Kohli produced an all-time great run of form, scoring the most runs ever by an individual batter at a men‚Äôs Cricket World Cup.
His 765 surpassed the previous record held by Sachin Tendulkar (673 in 2003) and came at an average of 96.62.
Only twice out of 11 innings did Kohli not reach at least a half century. And his three hundreds in the tournament saw him reach 50 career ODI tons, overtaking Tendulkar for the most in the history of the format.
4. Daryl Mitchell (New Zealand)
New Zealand‚Äôs run to the semi-finals was built on the back of a mountain of runs, and Daryl Mitchell played a big part in that.
DARYL MITCHELL'S HITS CAREER-BEST 130 IN DHARAMSALA | CWC23
His 552 runs in nine innings came at an average of 69 and strike-rate of 111.06, and showcased his great versatility ‚Äì building platforms at times and upping the scoring rate at others.
His 134 in a losing cause in the semi-final against India was a brave effort when his team needed it most.
5. KL Rahul (India)
The India right-hander was a model of consistency for his side throughout the world Cup as he amassed a decent total of 452 runs from 10 hits.
Rahul impressed mainly during the middle overs, scoring a tournament best 102 against the Netherlands in Bengaluru and contributing an even better innings of 97* against Australia at the start of the event.
The 31-year-old finished the World Cup with a superb average of 75.33, which was the third best overall for any batter during the tournament.
KL RAHUL DINES OUT ON AUSTRALIA WITH MATCH-WINNING KNOCK | POTM HIGHLIGHTS
6. Glenn Maxwell (Australia)
The Big Show provided two all-time moments with the bat. His century against the Netherlands was the fastest ever seen at a Men‚Äôs Cricket World Cup, coming off just 40 balls.
But his effort against Afghanistan was even more extraordinary.¬†
With Australia requiring 292 and slipping to 91/7, Maxwell produced arguably the greatest individual innings of all-time, scoring 201* from 128 balls as he battled pressure, Afghanistan‚Äôs spinners and crippling cramp to get his team across the line.
. Ravindra Jadeja (India)
India‚Äôs spin-bowling all-rounder played a crucial role for his team, taking key wickets throughout the middle overs and consistently turning the screw.
ADEJA RIPS ONE PAST BAVUMA | CWC23
His economy rate was among the best in the tournament, going for 4.25 per over as he brilliantly backed up the new-ball attack.
With the bat he played an important role at number seven too, scoring 120 runs in his five appearances in the middle.
8. Jasprit Bumrah (India)
The leader of India‚Äôs attack, Jasprit Bumrah was relentless in his excellence.
While being a threat in all sections of the innings, it was Bumrah‚Äôs new-ball brilliance that made the biggest impact for his team.
ONCE IN A GENERATION' BUMRAH ON RETURNING TO HIS BEST FOR INDIA | CWC23
He took wickets throughout the tournament, and proved extremely difficult to get away.
No bowler to have played more than a single game in the tournament was able to return a better economy rate than Bumrah‚Äôs 4.06 ‚Äì an even more remarkable stat considering he was so often in action when the fielding restrictions were in place.
9. Dilshan Madushanka (Sri Lanka)
Sri Lanka‚Äôs left-arm speedster Dilshan Madushanka was a revelation.
MADUSHANKA STRIKES BIG TO REMOVE ROHIT | CWC23
His 21 wickets put him firmly in the tournament‚Äôs top five wicket-takers, and he was a relentless threat with the new ball.
MADUSHANKA DOUBLE STRIKE JOLTS INDIA | CWC23
A haul of 5/80 against India was the pick of his efforts.
10. Adam Zampa (Australia)
Australia‚Äôs leading wicket-taker in the tournament, Adam Zampa equalled Muttiah Muralidaran for most wickets by a spinner in a single Men‚Äôs Cricket World Cup.
INSPIRED ZAMPA STEERS AUSTRALIA TO VICTORY | POTM HIGHLIGHTS | CWC23
His 23 wickets came at an average of 22.39, and he took three consecutive four-wicket hauls in the league stage, including a remarkable spell of 4/8 against the Netherlands.
Only Mohammed Shami took more wickets in the tournament than the Aussie leg-spinner.
And Zampa‚Äôs lower-order 29 against England ended up being pivotal in a match that put Australia in control of their progression to the semi-finals.
11. Mohammed Shami¬†(India)
The tournament‚Äôs top wicket-taker, Mohammed Shami was simply extraordinary for a team that he wasn‚Äôt even a part of at the start of the campaign.
Shami sat out his team‚Äôs first four matches, but was remarkable from thereon in, taking 24 wickets at an average of just 10.70 and 5.26.
Only four players in the history of the men‚Äôs game have taken more Cricket World Cup wickets than Shami's 55 ‚Äì Lasith Malinga (56) Mitchell Starc (65), Muttiah Muralitharan (68) and Glenn McGrath (71) ‚Äì with Shami‚Äôs returns coming in ten fewer matches than any of those above him in the list.
12th: Gerald Coetzee (South Africa)
South Africa needed a spark in their attack in the absence of Anrich Nortje, and found it in young Gerald Coetzee.
He bowled with pace and threat throughout the campaign, taking 20 wickets across his eight matches.
The 23-year-old finished with an average of 19.80 and economy of 6.23.

Suresh Raina reveals what proved the difference in World Cup final.docx,"""World Cup winner Suresh Raina believes the shrewd captaincy of skipper Pat Cummins was the major difference between Australia and India in the final of the ICC Men's Cricket World Cup.

Cummins made a bold call at the toss when he sent India into bat first and the move paid dividends as Australia restricted the tournament hosts to a modest total of 240 and eased to a six-wicket triumph on the back of a brilliant century from opener Travis Head.
But it wasn't just the decision at the toss that stood out for Raina, with the India great impressed by the way Cummins rotated his bowlers and the tactics the Australia captain used against his opponents.
""""What swung the game in Australia‚Äôs favour was Pat Cummins‚Äô captaincy,"""" Raina, a Cricket World Cup winner for India in 2011, said in his column for the¬†ICC.
""""The way he brought Glenn Maxwell in to the attack to get the wicket of Rohit Sharma with a brilliant catch from Travis Head was very smart.¬†
""""Adam Zampa was great too, as was Cummins himself in dismissing Virat Kohli.
""""They outplayed India and were very solid in their planning.""""
INSIDE THE AUSSIE DRESSING ROOM | CWC23 FINAL
Australia's bowlers received plenty of support in the field too, with their catching in the outfield a highlight and the many runs saved by diving and outstretched bodies also a standout for Raina.
""""Another big factor was Australia‚Äôs fielding, I think they saved 30 to 40 runs,"""" Raina noted.
""""From ball one, they were saving a lot of singles and boundaries. There was Travis‚Äô catch and some excellent work in the deep from David Warner and Marnus Labuschagne.
""""I think Cummins showed real temperament in his captaincy. He changed his bowlers knowing he could put pressure on each India batter even though they were all in such good form. His tactics made all the difference, and his planning and execution was perfect.""""
COMMENTARY TEAM SELECT THEIR FAVOURITE MOMENT OF WORLD CUP | CWC23
The victory was Australia's sixth in the history of the 50-over World Cup, while India remains with just two World Cup triumphs following previous successes in 1983 in England and on home soil in 2011.
While many were left disappointed that India couldn‚Äôt add another ICC title to their trophy cabinet, Raina was buoyed by the performance of his former side and believes they can make amends at the next edition of the tournament in South Africa, Zimbabwe and Namibia in 2027.
""""We will see the Indian team doing well again because they know how to reach the latter stages of tournaments now,"""" Raina said.
""""It just takes a bit of time to understand how to manage those pressure situations, especially when you‚Äôre at home.¬†
""""Sometimes when there‚Äôs a lot of pressure you can lose your focus, and I think that‚Äôs a lesson they will learn from this.""""

The supplementary qualifying tournaments also determined the¬†promotion and relegation¬†between the leagues. As it was the first use of the new process, teams were allocated to the three leagues based on their¬†ICC member status, ODI status and rank from the¬†2017‚Äì2019 ICC World Cricket League.[1]
